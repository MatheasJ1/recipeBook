# recipeBook
			
This project is a simple digital Recipe Book where you can store, look at, and organize recipes. Each recipe has ingredients, steps, tags, and a type (like dessert or main dish). The goal is to make it easy to find and manage different recipes.

What it can do:

Show all recipes or list them by type
Search for recipes by name, ingredient, or tag
View full recipe details
Rate recipes and see which ones have the best ratings
Change ingredient amounts based on how many servings you want
Add your own recipes


How it works:

The program uses a few classes and enums to keep things organized
Recipes, ingredients, and tags are stored using arrays and collections.
Loops and simple conditions handle things like searching, sorting, scaling, and rating recipes.
